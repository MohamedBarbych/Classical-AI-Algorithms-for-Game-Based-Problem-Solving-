# üé≤ Classical AI Algorithms for Game-Based Problem Solving

Welcome to **Classical AI Algorithms**! This repository demonstrates the core techniques of classical, symbolic AI (also known as **GOFAI - Good Old-Fashioned AI**) with applications in games like Chess, Mancala, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Sudoku. These exercises are designed to explore fundamental AI concepts through hands-on problem-solving in gaming contexts.

## üîç Overview
This repository is tailored for Java developers interested in symbolic AI approaches. Each algorithm is implemented with detailed comments and applied to classic games to illustrate real-world applications of AI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms Included
Each of these algorithms has unique advantages for solving game-related problems:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Ideal for exhaustive exploration, such as checking all possible moves in shallow game trees.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Dives deep into game states, helping find solutions in scenarios where complete branch exploration is required.
- **Heuristic Search (A\*)**: Uses heuristics for optimal pathfinding, often applied in strategy games to evaluate the best move.
- **Hill Climbing**: Suitable for optimization within game constraints, though it can get stuck in local optima.
- **Backtracking**: Effective for multi-constraint problems like Sudoku, where all possible configurations must be explored.

## üéÆ Applications in Games
This repository focuses on applying algorithms to the following classic games:

- **Chess**: Explores moves and strategies through BFS and DFS.
- **Mancala**: Analyzes potential strategies using depth-first and heuristic search.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Demonstrates simple search and heuristic methods.
- **Sudoku**: Solves constraints using backtracking.
